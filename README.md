## Air Quality in Canada Visualization

<br>**Question to be answered:** 
<br>Numerous research have suggested possibilities of air pollution exposure leading to detrimental health conditions for humans. [Health Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/2021-health-effects-indoor-air-pollution.html) estimates that air pollution contributes to **15,300 deaths per year** in Canada. To fight against air pollution, the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/campaigns/canadian-environment-week/clean-air-day/action-air-pollution.html#toc1) launched an ambitious plan, the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, which aims to reduce pollutants emissions to net-zero by 2050. In this project, I will investigate changes in trends in air pollution by looking at air pollutants emission from 1990 to 2020. Specifically, did the total emission decrease or increase during this period? 

In addition to major air pollutants, I will also focus on emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) which are particles whose size is less than 2.5 microns (millionth of a meter), or roughly 1/30 the thickness of a human hair. Such fine particles come from human sources such as power plant emissions, car and truck exhaust, cigarettes and tobacco fumes, as well as natural sources such as smoke from wild fires or volcanoes.  These particles can get deep into a person's lungs and may lead to adverse health effects such as premature mortality, increased heart and lung diseases, acute and chronic bronchitis and more. I will analyze the Canadian wildfire data and PM2.5 emissions to see if increased PM2.5 emissions can be attributed to wildfires.
